<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
 <td><center><li style="font-family:century gothic;">With online distance learning, I was able to manage my<br> time between responsibilities at home and as a student.<br> At first, I was not able to deal with online learning <br> as it had never been before. I can divide my time to <br>complete the assignments given by the lecturers.<br> Besides that, I also can do house chores like <br> tidying, cloth drapery and so on.</li></center></td>
 <td><center><li style="font-family:century gothic;">Online education is actually very good because it will save time.<br> While online class, I can do while eating and will not stress if only <br> focus on studying. Sometimes, some lecturers will provide video <br> tutorials and exercises, then students will need to do the work <br> and submit. During my free time, I would fill my time with the <br> completion of pending works. This way, I can do <br> assignments while studying.</li></center></td>

<tr>
<td><center><h2 style="font-family: algerian;">Always get information on time</h2></center></td>
<td><center><h2 style="font-family: algerian;">Stay positive!</h2></center></td>

<tr>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
 <td><center><li style="font-family:century gothic;">The environment in the classroom and at home is very different.<br> This is because when learning in the classroom, can ask questions <br>during the class and before the end of office hours. When studying<br> using online learning, if  do not know how to answer and <br>ask lecturers, it will always be informed on time. Just as <br>students should always be alert with the phone because the<br> lecturers will give more assignments.</li></center></td>
 <td><center><li style="font-family:century gothic;">When online learning, I felt overwhelmed and left behind because <br>I did not understand what the lecturer explained. Although<br> not easy for me to change my mind set to not think negative, I <br>will try to think positive and also  complete of all my assignments <br>and attend a lecture. But now, I remain stay positive during <br>the online learning because I realized when<br>think positive everything will be easier.</li></center></td>
